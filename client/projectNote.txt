tickets need not be transfered within platform? 
Because erc721 transfer method is unique in a way that disallows direct transfers, it uses an auction system to trade. 
However, auctions systems are unviable in a ticketing system. Which leads to letting the ticket buyer "mint", instead of buying (or transfering)
the ticket NFT the event creator minted.
