//Bugs

- connection not open on send();

- reason could not pin file to ipfs: Was using axios in backend XD. Axios is a client side method.

//Notes


- React.FC 
-enables usage of generics (React.FC<type>), which type the input of the functional component. 
-sets children (which is what the component encloses) to React.Node (React.Node accepts strings, html elements, and the general things.)
